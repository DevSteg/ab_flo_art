![Snapshot of Project](readme_files/img/af_snapshot.png)

Welcome to my milestone project for Code Institute Full Stack Frameworks with Django module. 
The Scope of the module was to build a fullstack site based around business logic used to control a centrally owned dataset.
The Site I have decided to build is a web store based around a my sisters art. 
The website sells original paintings and ceramics all painted and hand made by her.
AWS is used to hoast the static and media files, while heroku is used to host the site.

## User Experience (UX)

- ### User Stories

- ### Site Owner Goals
    ![SiteOwnersGoals](readme_files/img/site_owner_goals.png)

- ### Project Scope Plane
    While in the planning stage of the project I used the user stories and site owners goals to come up with a scope plane and features to include within the project.
    After coming up up with a list of features I created a feature importance and viability table which is below.

    ![ProjectViabilityTable](readme_files/img/project_viability_table.png)

## Design

* ### Typography
    The two fonts used on the project are *Bevan* for the page titles and logo, and *Rokkit* which is used for the main font throughout the project.
* ### Color Scheme
    The colour scheme for the project is ##f0ffff(Azure) and #90d4fcec(Anakiwa), both have been used accross the site to try and represent the sky as per the Artist's work.
    The body background is #fffafa(snow), this is to help with contrast, while staying within the theme.
* ### Imaging
    The images on the site were all provided by the Artist [Abigail Flower](https://www.instagram.com/abigailflower_/)
* ### CRUD Features
    Create, Read, Upload, Delete features are all available both to the users on their accounts and to the site owner for the products.
* ### Cards
    Bootstrap cards are used on the products page to make sure the products are responsive.
* ### CTA Images
    There are two images on the home page, to either go to ceramic products or art work made by the Artist.
* ### Navbar
    The navbar is fixed in place so the site user can access the navigation at all times. The nav bar is also reponsive with a menu button showing up on smaller screens.
